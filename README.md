Fashion Recommender System
Introduction
The Fashion Recommender System is a content-based recommendation application that suggests visually similar fashion items based on an image uploaded by the user. Using a pre-trained ResNet50 model, the system extracts image features and finds the closest matching items from a predefined dataset. It provides recommendations using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to locate similar fashion images based on feature embeddings.

Features
Upload an image of any fashion item.
Extract features from the uploaded image using a ResNet50 deep learning model.
Get recommendations of five visually similar fashion items from a dataset.
The recommendation is based on feature similarity using the Euclidean distance metric.
How It Works
Image Upload: Users can upload an image of a fashion item using the file uploader.

Feature Extraction: The uploaded image is processed through a ResNet50 model (pre-trained on ImageNet) to extract its feature embeddings. The image is resized to (224x224) for compatibility with the model.

Nearest Neighbor Search: Using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) with Euclidean distance, the system finds the closest matching items based on feature vectors from a predefined dataset (loaded from embeddings.pkl and filenames.pkl).

Recommendations: The five most similar images are displayed alongside the uploaded image as recommendations. These recommendations are generated by finding the images with the smallest distance between their feature embeddings and the uploaded image.

Files Included
app.py: The Streamlit application code for running the fashion recommender system.
embeddings.pkl: A pickle file containing precomputed feature embeddings for the fashion dataset images.
filenames.pkl: A pickle file containing the file paths or names of the images used in the dataset.
uploads/: Directory for temporarily storing uploaded images.
Installation
To run this Fashion Recommender System on your local machine, follow the steps below:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fashion-recommender.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd fashion-recommender
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create the uploads/ directory if it doesn't exist:

bash
Copy code
mkdir uploads
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:

streamlit: For building the web application interface.
tensorflow: For using the ResNet50 pre-trained model for feature extraction.
PIL: For handling image uploads and processing.
numpy: For numerical operations on image arrays.
scikit-learn: For KNN search to recommend similar items.
pickle: For loading precomputed feature embeddings and filenames.
Install these dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit tensorflow Pillow numpy scikit-learn pickle5
Usage
Upload an image of a fashion item (e.g., a dress or a shoe).
The app will process the image and display five visually similar items from the dataset.
The results are based on feature similarity, which is calculated using the KNN algorithm.
Future Enhancements
Improve the dataset by including more diverse fashion items.
Add additional filtering criteria (e.g., category, color).
Integrate the recommender system with an e-commerce platform for real-time product recommendations.
